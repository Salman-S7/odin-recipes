    <ul>
        <li><b>Eggs:</b>This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><b>Flour:</b>All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
        <li><b>Milk:</b>Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
        <li><b>Oil: </b>A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b> A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
        <li><b> Baking powder:</b> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><b> Salt: </b> A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
        <li><b>Vanilla:</b>A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Cooking spray:</b>You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</li>
